emdi is Enhanced MDI

This improves the MDI experience by:
* Introducing the concept of Main Views and Sub Views
* Introducing the concept of Document
* Each Document can have any number of Main Views open across any number of QMainWindows
* Each QMainWindow can have at most one of any type of Sub View open
* API user is responsible for ensuring proper model/view coherence
* Two main classes -- EMDI and DocProfile.
* EMDI maintains table of Documents, Views, etc., and also:
*   Duplicating a Main View
*   Popping out a duplicate Main View into new QMainWindow
*   Dragging out of a Main View into a new or existing QMainWindow
*   Maintaining Sub Views associated with a given Document as Main View is popped out or dragged
*   Closing of Document when all Main Views are closed
*   Closing of QMainWindow when all its Main Views are closed
* DocProfile is interface which must be subclassed by API user
*   OpenDoc, CloseDoc, GetMainView, GetSubview
* Does not require subclassing QMainWindow or QMDISubWindow

EMDI is used my main to create new main QMainWindows
A subwindow will be assigned to one frameType.
Multiple QWidget *views will then become the content of the subwindow,
depending on which Document is selected

Try not to replicate state that is already implicit/inherent in Qt system,
eg which window is active, which are children of which, etc.
